When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would allow me to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To ensure that changes made in the remote repository is synced with the local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of a repository (can be local or remote). A branch occurs within a directory/repository. We usually start out with a master branch and create new branches for purposes like creating the same application in a different language or if we want to target a different audience. Forking is only available in GitHub (not Git) and involves copying someone else's public repository into my own git hub account and making any changes I deem necessary.
