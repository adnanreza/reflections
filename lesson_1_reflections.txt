How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

the FC/diff command printed the exact blocks of text that were different
for each file and that helped pin point the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can go through incremental changes made to a particular file to pinpoint or at least narrow down the possible list of errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

We might forget to manually commit in Git. whereas having versions automatically saved helps us avoid this issue.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git gives more flexibility to user and involves manual saving. On the other hand systems like Google Docs use auto saving and hence treat each file separately as the user does not manually save files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows us the entire list of commits to a certain git repository. git diff points out the exact differences i.e. the lines added and/or deleted when a commit is made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I could easily go back to a previous version of my work that works!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Right now nothing! I need to finish the other units first!
